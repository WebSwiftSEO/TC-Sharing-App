📜 Open-Source Licenses

This project embraces a full spectrum of open-source licenses, ensuring maximum flexibility, transparency, and community-driven development. It’s primarily licensed under GNU GPLv3, while incorporating compatibility with MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, and Creative Commons to encourage widespread adoption and innovation.

Why Open Source?
Open-source projects represent a fundamental shift toward social democracy in technology. By removing profit-driven barriers and prioritizing transparency, they empower individuals and communities to collaborate freely, fostering ecosystems that serve people and humanity first.

Why Blockchain?
Blockchain decentralizes control, eliminating single points of failure and corruption. When combined with open-source principles, it creates a resilient system where power is distributed among users—not corporations—ensuring fairness, transparency, and community governance.

Together, open-source and blockchain build systems that:

    🏛 Promote Transparency — All code is visible and verifiable.
    🌐 Encourage Collaboration — Anyone can contribute, fix, and improve.
    💸 Prevent Exploitation — No hidden agendas or paywalls.
    🌍 Serve Humanity First — Systems that put people before profit.

By embracing socially democratic digital infrastructures, we take a step toward solving global inequities, fostering fair trade, and building a global community centered around connection, education, and happiness.
